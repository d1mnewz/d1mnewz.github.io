You always have to start with something. 

I've got a lot things to say, some of them are worth hearing, some aren't.

I look like an ambitious young man who says a lot of loud words. True.

Why am I blogging? 

It seems to be funny, huh? 

I do like practecieng my Englich also. 

One of the ways of sharing my thoughts. No one is reading this one, but who cares? %)

And I suck at blogging. Just want this part to change, real progress comes only with practice. Seems legit, right?


Well, a lot of crazy things are going on and I am one these things. 
I'mma do it till i get game-over flash, but it's far from over.

So I'm only 18 and I'm only getting better. If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now - for real.
